	  We are coming along fast, but not that fast as we hoped! :(<br>
	  Anyway there is a great chance that we go alpha in three weeks!<br>We have almost finished the basic techtree which currently holds 74!! totaly different technologies! With aproximate 10 more to come!<br>
	  <br>
	  Hm, I won't loose a word about the other techtrees, cause I like secrets ;)
	  So with finishing the techtree we will start to redisign all units, buildings, covert operation, etc. Thats a load of database working and figuering!
	  And will take its time!<br>
	  We will post some more screenshots soon! And hopefully that pretty nice flash-movie nemesis designed! :)<br><br>
	  Stay alert for the alpha signup! There will be at max. a hundered alpha player slots!

	  He will take over the Spaceregents news page for the moment. So prepare for a new, better and frequently updated

	  "OMG! Another Space strategy!"
	  Well, we know that there are quite a lot of these games out there.
	  But wait!<br>
	  Space Regents is going to be the next generation of those games (what did you expect? ;)<br>
	  First of all. It's not copied. Sure there will be colonization, alliances
	  and all the stuff a space strategy MUST contain.<br>
	  <br>
	  Heres a short list of things already included:<br>
	  - Big, dynamic starmap<br>
	  - Systemmaps<br>
	  - 10 different planettypes<br>
	  - Many techs<br>
	  - Many planetar & orbital buildings<br>
	  - Alliances<br>
	  - Travelroutes<br>
	  - Jumpgates<br>
	  - Trade & Traderoutes<br>
	  - Pirates<br>
	  - Battlefields in space and on ground<br>
	  - Huge fleets and even more gigantic invasion-armys<br>	  
	  - Covert Operations<br>
	  - Nuclear, biological & chemical warfare<br>
	  - Worst written english<br>
	  - and more that I must have forgotten<br>
	  <br>
	  This is going to be included in the first beta or later:<br>
	  - Clean Oxford english ;)<br>
	  - Admirals, with stats and inventory!<br>
	  - TOP SECRET, but it'll kick ass<br>
	  - Skins<br>
	  - Different language support<br>
	  - and more that I can't think of right now
	  <br>
	  <br>
  	  We are going to start the first closed alpha round soon!<br>
	  If you've been nice last year, did your homework and brushed your teeth you might get the chance to join the round!<br>
	  Every alpha player can gain a bit of immortality by giving a constellation a name.
	  So check back often, so you won't miss the official inofficial sign up!! :)

	  Wohoo! This is the first time some info about Space Regents is posted public!
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  We are three people, Mop, Gorlord and me that design our little baby here.
	  I don't really know who of us had the idea, but we were inspired by Planetarion and Imperial Conflict.
	  The first note I found about our great plan to design Space Regents were dated around May 2000.<br>
	  It said "Lass uns auch sowas wie Planetarion machen, nur besser" (Lets do something similar to Planteraion, just better ;)
	  <br>
	  I guess you will find some more info and pictures about Space Regents soon, so check back often. :)
	  <br>
	  <br>  
	  Space Regents is going to need the new SVG Plugin (Scaleable Vector Graphics) from Adobe.<br>
	  You can download the plugin at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/">www.adobe.com/svg/</a>.
